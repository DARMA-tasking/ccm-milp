* at least version 3.10 of [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

#### Build and Run on *nix Systems:
* execute `ccmake .` where `assignments.f90` is located on your system, or replace `.` with the path to it if an out-of-source build is preferred, and select the desired Fotran compiler;
* configure by pressing `c` then generate the `makefile` by pressing `g`;
* build with `make`;
* run the generated `assignments` executable.

#### What to Expect:
A text output in the terminal that will verify the aforementioned equations and examples.
